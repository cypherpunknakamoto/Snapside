## What is SnapSide?

SnapSide is a productivity app for macOS that revolutionizes how you communicate with AI assistants. Instead of typing long descriptions of what you're looking at, just capture your screen and let AI see exactly what you're working on.

### The Problem
Ever find yourself typing out a long description of what's on your screen to ChatGPT, Claude, or Perplexity? Describing error messages, code snippets, or design layouts takes time and often loses important context.

### The Solution
SnapSide adds a floating button to your screen. One click captures your current window and copies it to your clipboard—ready to paste directly into any AI conversation. Show, don't tell.

## Key Features

- **🎯 One-Click Screenshots**: Floating button in the top-right corner
- **📋 Auto-Clipboard**: Screenshots automatically copied—just paste
- **🪟 Smart Window Capture**: Captures the active window, not your entire screen
- **⚡️ Keyboard Shortcut**: Quick access with ⌘⇧6
- **🔒 Privacy First**: Everything stays on your Mac—zero data collection
- **🤖 AI-Optimized**: Perfect for ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and more

## How to Use

### Basic Workflow
1. **Click** the floating SnapSide button (or press ⌘⇧6)
2. **Screenshot** is captured and copied to clipboard
3. **Paste** into your AI assistant (⌘V)
4. **Get better answers** with full visual context

### Perfect For
